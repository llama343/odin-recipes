    <h3>Delicious fudgey brownie</h3>
    <p>Move over boxed brownies! Fudgy brownies with a shiny, crackly crust and surprise ingredient - mashed banana -
        which adds just a hint of delicious flavor. These brownies won third place at the Minnesota 2009 state fair and
        they are easy to make! </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup sifted all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> tablespoons salted butter </li>
        <li>5 ounces semisweet chocolate </li>
        <li>1 ounce bittersweet chocolate </li>
        <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar </li>
        <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>½ large banana, mashed </li>
        <li>½ cup chopped toasted walnuts </li>
        <li>½ cup semisweet chocolate chips </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spray the bottom of an 8x8-inch metal baking pan with
            cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, cocoa, and 1/4 teaspoon plus a pinch of salt together in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat. Add semisweet and bittersweet chocolate to melted butter and
            stir until smooth. Remove from heat; set aside for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix brown sugar, eggs, and banana by hand until combined, about 1 minute. Add melted chocolate
            mixture to banana mixture and stir well, about 1 minute more. Mix flour mixture slowly into chocolate,
            stirring just enough to combine. Fold in walnuts and chocolate chips. Spread batter into the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs, 35 to 40
            minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in the pan on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before cutting.
        </li>
    </ol>
