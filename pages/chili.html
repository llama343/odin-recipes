    <h3>Easy and Delicious Homemade Chili</h3>
    <p>My friend's love of smokey chipotle peppers inspired this recipe. It comes together perfectly and is a unique
        chili that will stand out against others. It is a spicy chili that at the same time is mellow. It gives you the
        kick without the lingering burn like many chilis do. </p>
    <P>This creamy and delicious chili will leave you wanting more.</P>

    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and sausage in the hot skillet until some of
            the fat renders, 2 to 3 minutes; add onion and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the meats are
            browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer beef mixture to a slow cooker.</li>
        <li>Stir kidney beans, chili beans, diced tomatoes, crushed tomatoes, celery, green bell pepper, red bell
            pepper, chipotle chiles, bacon bits, chili sauce, hot pepper sauce, chili powder, brown sugar, cumin, and
            salt with the beef mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low until vegetables are completely tender but the celery retains a slight bit of firmness, 6 to 8
            hours (or 3 to 4 hours on High).</li>
    </ol>
