    <h3>Rich hot chocolate</h3>
    <p>I was always taught that hot chocolate was made with chocolate and hot cocoa was made with cocoa powder. This is
        the richest hot chocolate you'll ever have. I don't remember where I got this recipe from. Add cinnamon or
        nutmeg, if desired. Serve in small tea or coffee cups, because it is very rich!</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>12 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract </li>
        <li>6 cups half-and-half </li>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chocolate, butter, and vanilla extract in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir
                frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted
                and completely smooth, about 5 minutes. Add half-and-half slowly to avoid cooling chocolate mixture too
                much, stirring while you add it. Heat until hot but not boiling.</li>
        </ol>
